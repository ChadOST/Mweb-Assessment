# Mweb-Assessment

The following is an automation assessment assigned by Mweb
If you have any questions about any of the steps below please contact me at xad.ahri@gmail.com

**Running the Tests**
The project can be cloned and opened in any Java IDE (I used VS Code)
Navigate To the "tests" folder (\Mweb-Assessment\src\test\java\example\example\tests)
From here you can simply run the methods labelled with @Test
These tests can also be run with maven clean test from the console, but this is untested at this time

**Reporting**
Reports can be found at \Mweb-Assessment\ExtentReports
I have included 3 example reports for you to look at
Reporting will always generate a new extent report without replacing the old one

A sample framework based on Page Object Model, Selenium, TestNG using Java.
